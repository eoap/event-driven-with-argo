# Hands-on

## Deployments
Open [event-driven-with-argo](https://github.com/eoap/dev-platform-eoap/tree/main/event-driven-with-argo) to learn how to deploy deferent components on a cluster.
## Redis' Subscriber Implementation:
Open notebook "[sub.ipynb](../practice-labs/sub.ipynb)" to run a hands-on exercise on Redis' Subscriber. Note that, it is essential to run subscriber before publisher to ensure no events are missed.

## Redis' Publisher Implementation
Open notebook "[pub.ipynb](../practice-labs/pub.ipynb)" to run a hands-on exercise on Redis' Publisher.

> Notice: You must monitor both running notebooks to analyse the process of event handeling.
